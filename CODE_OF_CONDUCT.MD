#Code of Conduct

Best-resume-ever values the contributions of volunteer developers. Folks from various backgrounds can create pull requests, update our documentation, write new code, modify existing code and much more. Best-resume-ever is created, maintained, and improved by users such as yourself.

Best-Resume-Ever wants to foster an inclusive, respectful, and successful community for all. Anyone can participate in contributing.

To maintain this inclusive and respectful community, we have created a code of conduct for all to follow. See below for behavior that is not allowed. Contributers who fail to follow these rules risk losing the privilege of making further contributions to the project, at the discretion of lead developers. Depending on the severity of the violation, the person may be given a warning or removed from the project immediately. Please contact ___ to report a suspected violation. 

We, at Best-resume-ever, choose to avoid the below behaviors to maintain a safe space for all contributers.

* Racist, homophobic and/or sexist comments.
* Excessive commenting (i.e making 100 pull requests in a short amount of time, commenting several times with unnecessary information). Also known as trolling.
* Harassing users or other contributers.
* Posting private and personal information about yourself or others.
